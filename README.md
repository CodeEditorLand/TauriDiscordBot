# Svelte Bot

something can go here

# Running for development

1. Once you have the bot cloned and have run `pnpm install` then you need to make a .env file and fill out the fields:

    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2. Run the bot with `pnpm dev`

> if the bot has a error of cannot find module dist/index.js just give it a sec to compile and nodemon will auto restart!
